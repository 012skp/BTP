DALB Load Balancing
#####################

Problems
############

1. Load Collection (which is done when load increases thresh-hold) causes latency in load transfer.
=> Load Informative Strategy Paper2.


2. Large Number of Load Collection under heavy-load condition on whole network.
   Almost half of the controllers will be doing load collections always.
   

3. Suffling of switch-contorller links after long-running of controller.
=> Taking into consideration RTT done in Paper2.

4. Controller load threshhold doesn't go down automatically.
=> Do load collection whenever Currentload-Threshhold > some constant.
